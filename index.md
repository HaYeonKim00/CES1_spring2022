## What is this project?

This was part of a collaborative installation project that was completed as a class. Everyone's ESP32 was stuck in a small envelope and hung in the hallway of the fith floor Milstien. Battery was soldered individually and was connected to the device which was aimed to last for two to three hours. 


### What was on the screen?

We were instructed to print any words on the screen. I chose a line from the movie "About Time": "We're all traveling through time together every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride." 

### About how I printed the screen

I assumed that the string connected will rotate and spin a lot. Thus made the line be visible on all four sides. The lines were made to rotate. To clearly make viewers read the line, I gave the contrast to the word color and background color. Name of the movie was written in a different color since I wanted to make a distinction between the line and the title. Rather than using artistic techniques and so much variation on words, I wanted the words in the line to be clearly presented. 

### Hardships

Connecting ESP32 to my computer to use Arduino required downloading an extra driver to install a new port. Another hardship was getting used to the code for ESP32 but used example codes in Arduino as a reference.
